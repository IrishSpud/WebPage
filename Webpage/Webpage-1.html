	<p>Despite the constant negative ipsum covfefe. Lorem Ispum is a choke artist. It chokes! Lorem Ipsum is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why it’s former users left it for something else. They made a good decision. I know words. I have the best words. I write the best placeholder text, and I'm the biggest developer on the web by far... While that's mock-ups and this is politics, are they really so different?

I think my strongest asset maybe by far is my temperament. I have a placeholding temperament. Lorem Ipsum best not make any more threats to your website. It will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.
<br>
Look at these words. Are they small words? And he referred to my words - if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee. I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words.

He’s not a word hero. He’s a word hero because he was captured. I like text that wasn’t captured.
